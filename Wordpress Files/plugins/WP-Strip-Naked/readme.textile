 * All built in taxonomies and leaves only the "nav-menu" taxonomy
 * The built in post type "Post"
 * Changes the option "show on front" to "pages"
 * Changes the initial posts query to search for the page with the lowest ID
 * All admin bar items and leaves only the site name that can be used to access the public view
 * Admin Menu items and submenu items: Posts, Links, Comments
 * The admin menu items for Plugin & Theme Editor
 * All Settings admin menu items and replaces them with the "All Settings" Page and makes it only accessible for 'manage_options' capability
 * Removes the "capitalPdangit" filter from content, title and comment text, in case you add those filter in CPT related stuff

You can now remove the "Feeds" and "Pages" post type with switching 0/1 on the "All Settings" page.
